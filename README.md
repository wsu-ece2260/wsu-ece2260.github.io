# ECE 2260 Circuits and Signals

Fundamental electric-circuit techniques including: time domain transient responses for 1st and 2nd order circuits, Laplace transforms, Fourier series, and filters.
Lecture and lab combination.

## Learning objectives

* A knowledge of transient responses for 1st and 2nd order circuits.
* An understanding of how Laplace transforms apply to circuits.
* An understanding of how Fourier series and transforms apply to signals.
* An ability to construct simple passive filters.
